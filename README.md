This is an exploratory of machine learning models attempting to predict heart disease outcomes.

All data is stored as a singular .csv in /data/

src/eda_prep.ipynb contains all EDA done on the data set, no models are trained in it, however it provides a good overview of the dataset and it's limitations

src/MLPipelines.ipynb contains all of the model creation, currently 5 models, each compared with one another using a variety of metrics.
